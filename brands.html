	<i> <b>Difference between Audi and Volkwagen?</b> </i>
	<p> This is an incredibly common question and what that I struggled with. One might ask, whats the difference between a VW with all features versus a mid-range Audi? Isn't the price the same? </p>

	<br>

	<p> This is a great question and one that I do not really have a clear answer for. Audi is known for more luxury vehicles. Back in the good old days, this meant more power and better features. However, with modern commodities such as sunroofs, apple car play and leather seats becoming common options on VWs and Audis the difference in luxury starts to diminsh. This is the same with the engine as well, the 2.0 TSI is found in the most Audis and most Volkswagens. In my honest and humble opinion the difference becomes evident once you start looking past the initial Audi models. For example the rs, or racing line, often contains a 5 cylinder engine with much greater power output. Finally, there is the aspect of image as well. The sportier Volkswagens (GTI and GLI) are often associated with young hipsters whereas the Audi is marketed with elegance and prestige. The closing thought from a practical standpoint, unless if you can afford a higher end Audis or specifically want a luxury feel then stick with the Volkswagen.</p>
