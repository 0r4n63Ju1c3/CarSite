For the work itself, I used my own previous pex as a starting point. Because of this, I used the same css - styling sheets from the web development pex and altered it 
to fit the new website. Similarly, I also recycled some of the core structure from this pex. Other than this, I used the examples presented on Dr Coffman's website for
parsing data and javascript formatting. I also used W3 schools to teach me how to make sections within HTML that you can navigate to. Besides what was mentioned above,
I did not work with anyone else or use any other resources.
